    <h1>DURGA PUJA-2025</h1>
    <p class="text1">Durga is an ancient goddess of Hinduism according to 
        available archeological and textual evidence. However, the origins 
        of Durga Puja are unclear and undocumented.</p>
    <p class="text1">Some versions of the Puranas mention Durga Puja to be a 
        spring festival, while the Devi-Bhagavata Purana and two other Shakta 
        Puranas mentions it to be an autumn festival. The Ramayana manuscripts 
        are also inconsistent. Versions of Ramayana found in the north, west, 
        and south of the Indian subcontinent describe Rama to be remembering 
        Surya (the Hindu sun god) before his battle against Ravana, but the 
        Bengali manuscripts of Ramayana, such as the Krittivasi Ramayana, a 
        15th-century manuscript by Krittivasa, mention Rama to be worshipping 
        Durga.[44] As per the legend, Rama worshipped Durga in the autumn to 
        have her blessings before defeating Ravana. While he was preparing for 
        the worship of the goddess, Durga hid one of the 108 flowers of lotus, 
        very essential for her worship. Having found only 107 of 108 lotuses at 
        the time of the worship, Rama decided to offer one of his eyes in place 
        of that lotus. When he was about to offer his eye, Durga appeared and 
        told him that she had only hidden the flower in order to test his 
        devotion and she was satisfied with it. She blessed Rama and he 
        continued with her worship. Since the gods are believed to be 
        sleeping during autumn, the awakening rite of the Durga puja is also 
        known as akƒÅla bodhana.</p>
